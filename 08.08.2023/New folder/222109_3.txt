Question 3

1)main.c
test_func2 should be corrected without breaking the line
Return 0 should be corrected as return 0

2)my_header1.h
#include my_header.h statement should be in one line

3)my_header2.h
including my_header1.h will cause an infine recursion

4)test1.c and test2.c
prinf() statement should be on the same line
since stdio.h header file is not included printf() function will not work
